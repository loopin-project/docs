# ComfyUI | How to Implement Clay Style Filters

This guide will introduce you to deploying `Stable Diffusion`'s `Comfy UI` on `LooPIN` with a single click, and to the initial experiences with the clay style filter. `Comfy UI` employs a node-based operational approach, offering enhanced control, easier replication, and fine-tuning of the output results, and allows for the customization of personalized workflows upon mastery.

> 🔥NEW🔥 If you want to try it first, go to our interactive demo: 👉🏻 [Clay Style Demo](/playground/comfyui-clay-demo)

![playground-demo-comfyui-clay](comfyUI.assets/playground-demo-comfyui-clay.png)

## Introduction to ComfyUI

`Comfy UI` utilizes a node-based operation approach. It offers better support for the `Stable Diffusion XL 1.0` model compared to other WebUIs, allowing visible workflow integration of different models (such as the Base model and the Refiner model). This node-based approach increases controllability, facilitating replication and fine-tuning of output results, and enabling the customization of personalized workflows after proficiency is attained.

## Installation of ComfyUI Nodes

### Configuring GPU Instances

For detailed interactive guidance, please visit the following page: [LooPIN Liquidity Pool](/docs/quick-start/swap)

**1. LooPIN Liquidity Pool:**

Navigate to LooPIN's liquidity pool ([LooPIN Network Pool](https://loopin.network/pool)), and use $LOOPIN tokens to purchase GPU time. As an example, select the appropriate GPU model based on your requirements and budget from [GPU UserBenchmark](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/).

**2. Token Exchange for GPU Resources:**

- Select the necessary quantity of $LOOPIN tokens.
- Adjust the slider to choose the number of GPUs.
- Confirm the exchange amount and finalize the transaction.

**3. Accessing Jupyter Notebook:**

Following a successful transaction, access the Jupyter Notebook via your remote server under **Rented Servers** and **Server**. Usually, the instance is ready within 2-4 minutes.

**4. Verifying GPU Activation:**

Within the Jupyter Notebook, launch a new terminal window, execute the `nvidia-smi` command, and verify if the GPU is active.

## Generating Test Images with ComfyUI

![comfyUI-clay-style-overview](comfyUI.assets/comfyUI-clay-style-overview.png)

In the ComfyUI interface, you can view the clay style image display box at the top. To verify the deployment's success, perform the following steps:

1. Click `choose file to upload` under Load Image to upload the original picture.
2. Click the `Queue Prompt` button on the right to initiate image generation.
3. Wait approximately 5-10 seconds for the image to be generated and displayed on the interface.

If the image is successfully generated, it confirms that `ComfyUI` is fully operational.
