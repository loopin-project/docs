## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- An active LooPIN network account.
- Sufficient idle GPU instances online and not already committed to the liquidity pool if you intend to sell GPU hours.
- Adequate $LOOPIN balance if you are looking to buy GPU hours.

## How to Buy GPU Hours

Follow these steps to acquire GPU hours using $LOOPIN tokens:

1. **Navigate to the Pool Section**: Start here to initiate a purchase.
2. **Allocate Tokens**: Decide the amount of $LOOPIN tokens you wish to use to buy GPU hours.
3. **Select GPUs**: Use the slider to choose how many GPUs you want to engage at one time. We automatically calculate the valid GPU hours per GPU for your swap, with a minimum balance of 1 hour required.
4. **Confirm Swap Amounts**: Review the amount of $LOOPIN tokens being swapped for GPU hours.
5. **Execute Swap**: Once you click swap and the transaction is successful, head to the **Server** section under **Rented Servers** to access the Jupyter notebook from your newly rented remote server. It usually takes 2-4 minutes to start an instance.

## How to Sell GPU Hours

If you're interested in selling your GPU hours, follow these instructions:

1. **Access the Pool Section**: This is where you can list your GPU hours for sale.
2. **Set Available Hours**: Choose how many GPU hours you wish to sell. For example, if you have 1 GPU online, you can sell up to 24 hours, displayed as your GPU hours balance. You can switch between different GPUs to adjust the pool.
3. **Select Target GPU and Confirm Swap Details**: Choose the GPU you wish to allocate and confirm the swap details, including the amounts swapped from and to.
4. **Collateral Requirement**: Note that selling GPU hours requires posting collateral, which is slightly higher than the amount you will receive. This collateral is returned if you successfully fulfill the GPU hours without errors; otherwise, it is forfeited as a penalty. The swap fee is permanently burned to maintain token balance. Details on collateral can be found in our token documentation.
5. **Finalize the Swap**: After clicking swap, once the swap is successful, check your server section. You will find your GPU marked as **In Use**.

By following these steps, you can efficiently trade GPU hours on LooPIN, whether you're looking to leverage additional computing resources or monetize your idle GPUs.
