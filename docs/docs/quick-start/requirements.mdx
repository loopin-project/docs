## Network Requirements

LooPIN network operates on top of Kubernetes (K8S). The table below outlines the [network port requirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/ports-and-protocols/):

| Protocol | Direction | Port Range  | Purpose           | Used By              |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 22          | LooPIN Connect    | All                  |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 9789        | LooPIN Worker     | All                  |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 10250       | Kubelet API       | Self, Control plane  |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 10256       | kube-proxy        | Self, Load balancers |
| TCP      | Inbound   | 30000-32767 | NodePort Services | All                  |

## Supported GPUs for Staking Rewards

Currently, we only support the following GPUs for staking rewards. Upon new machines registered and online, we will airdrop the following tokens for the initial setup (enough for the first 24 hours of staking):

| GPU        | $LOOPIN Tokens |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| RTX 3080   | 5              |
| RTX 3090   | 7              |
| RTX 4090   | 15             |
| A100       | 50             |
| A5000      | 7              |
| RTX 4070   | 7              |
| Tesla V100 | 7              |
| Tesla T4   | 2              |
| RTX 3070   | 5              |
| RTX 4080   | 10             |

This list will be updated over time as we add support for more GPUs.

## Installation Process

To install, run the following command in your terminal (Interactive guidance at [On board](/docs/quick-start/onboard)):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://files.loopin.network/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --code <your-unique-code>
```

### Expected Output

Upon successful installation, you should see an output similar to this:
