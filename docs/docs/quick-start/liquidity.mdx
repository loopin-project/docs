## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you meet the following hardware and software requirements:

- An account on [loopin.network](https://loopin.network). Sign up if you haven't already!
- A running **Nvidia GPU** online and connect to LooPIN network.

## Let's Add Liquidity!

Once your setup is complete, it's time to start utilizing your idle GPU hours:
- Navigate to **Pool** in the navbar and jump into the liquidity section.
- Select **GPUs** and choose your idle GPUs for liquidity.
- Ensure you have sufficient balance in your wallet, as the actual staking of $LOOPIN tokens will be deducted from your wallet and returned upon removal of the liquidity.
- After adding liquidity, return to the **Server** section. You will find your server now tagged with an **LP** indicating it's part of the liquidity pool.

## How to Remove Liquidity

- Navigate to the **Server** section and select your target GPU.
- Click on the **Remove Liquidity** button.
- Done! Your server is now removed from the liquidity pool and you can sell your GPU hours or remove the server.

### And... You're Set!

Congratulations! Your server is now online in the LooPIN liquidity pool and qualifies for daily staking rewards.

Happy computing with LooPIN!
