# Add or Remove Liquidity

Dive into decentralized computing liquidity pool in just a few steps.

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'
import videoUrl from './Liquidity.mp4'

<div style={{ position: "relative", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%", colorScheme: "dark", borderRadius: "10px" }}>
    <ReactPlayer controls url={videoUrl} />
</div>

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you meet the following hardware and software requirements:

- An account on [loopin.network](https://loopin.network). Sign up if you haven't already!
- A running **Nvidia GPU** online and connect to LooPIN network.

## Let's Add Liquidity!

Once your setup is complete, it's time to start utilizing your idle GPU hours:
- Navigate to **Pool** in the navbar and jump into the liquidity section.
- Select **GPUs** and choose your idle GPUs for liquidity.
- Ensure you have sufficient balance in your wallet, as the actual staking of $LOOPIN tokens will be deducted from your wallet and returned upon removal of the liquidity.
- After adding liquidity, return to the **Server** section. You will find your server now tagged with an **LP** indicating it's part of the liquidity pool.

## How to Remove Liquidity

- Navigate to the **Server** section and select your target GPU.
- Click on the **Remove Liquidity** button.
- Done! Your server is now removed from the liquidity pool and you can sell your GPU hours or remove the server.

## Troubleshooting Verification Issues

If you've added liquidity and your status remains in "**Verifying**" after 20 minutes, there might be an issue with the liquidity transfer. Here's what to do:

1. **Check Your Wallet**
   - Verify if your wallet has been properly debited for the liquidity sent earlier

2. **If Liquidity Has Not Been Debited:**
   - Wait for up to 1 hour for the status to be reset
   - Keep your server online during this period
   - Once the status is reset, try adding liquidity again following the previous guidance

:::note
There's no need to remove your server - just wait for the status reset and try again.

### And... You're Set!

Congratulations! Your server is now online in the LooPIN liquidity pool and qualifies for daily staking rewards.

Happy computing with LooPIN!
