# On Board

Welcome to LooPIN! Ready to dive into decentralized computing? Let's get you set up in just 5 minutes.

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'
import videoUrl from './Onboard.mp4'

<div style={{ position: "relative", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%", colorScheme: "dark", borderRadius: "10px" }}>
    <ReactPlayer controls url={videoUrl} />
</div>

## 1. System Requirements

Before you get started, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- A stable network connection and open ports for cluster access
- An **Ubuntu system** with **Nvidia GPUs** installed, as currently, LooPIN only supports this configuration
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** is recommended

## 2. Installation Process

### A. Initial Setup
1. **Register on LooPIN**: Head over to [loopin.network](https://loopin.network) and sign up using your email or Google account.
2. **Prepare Your Machine**: Ensure you have a bare metal machine with an Nvidia GPU. Navigate to the "server" section on the navbar and click on "Deploy a new machine".

### B. CLI Worker Registration
1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.
2. Run the following command to register your machine as a LooPIN worker (Find it in your guidance page):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://files.loopin.network/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --code <your-unique-code> --ip <your-ip>
```
This command downloads and executes the LooPIN installation script, registering your machine with the provided unique code. (Optional) You can also provide your machine's IP addressâ€”usually, the script auto-detects it.

### C. Verification
The script will check if your machine meets the requirements and will install necessary drivers, including the Nvidia GPU driver. It will then verify your setup and register your worker. Upon successful installation, you should see the message:
```bash
LooPIN Client Connected! Waiting for the on-chain verification...
```
This indicates that the client application is installed and awaiting connection. The first-time connection may take approximately 5-10 minutes, depending on your network speed.

## 3. Post-Installation Checks

### A. Worker Status Check
When you see "ok connected on port 9789," immediately check the worker status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status loopin-worker.service
```
If it shows error EOF, restart it immediately:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart loopin-worker.service
```

### B. Host Configuration
Ensure your `/etc/hosts` file contains:
```bash
159.69.58.107    easzlab.io.local
```
You can verify this using:
```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```
:::note
- No reboot is needed to apply this change
- This needs to be checked at each installation or reinstallation of LooPIN
- If you use HiveOS, note that HiveOS resets the `/etc/hosts` file on every reboot
:::

### C. Monitoring Commands
You can use these commands to detect potential issues:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u containerd -n 5 -f 
sudo journalctl -u kubelet -n 5 -f 
sudo journalctl -u loopin-worker -n 5 -f
```

## 4. Uninstallation Process

If you need to remove LooPIN from your system, follow these steps:

1. (Optional) Download the loopin executable if you don't have it:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://files.loopin.network/loopin -o loopin && chmod +x loopin
```

2. Run the uninstallation command:
```bash
sudo ./loopin --uninstall
```

### What the Uninstallation Does
The uninstallation process will:
1. Delete the LooPIN controller access
2. Remove the loopin-worker from your system

You should see output similar to:
```bash
Uninstalling LooPIN components...
Removed LooPIN controller access
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/loopin-worker.service.
Stopped and removed LooPIN worker service.
Removed LooPIN worker executable.
ðŸ‘‹ LooPIN has been successfully uninstalled from your system.
