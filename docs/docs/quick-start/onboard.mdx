# On Board

Welcome to LooPIN! Ready to dive into decentralized computing? Let's get you set up in just 5 minutes.

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'
import videoUrl from './Onboard.mp4'

<div style={{ position: "relative", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%", colorScheme: "dark", borderRadius: "10px" }}>
    <ReactPlayer controls url={videoUrl} />
</div>

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- A stable network connection and open ports for cluster access.
- An **Ubuntu system** with **Nvidia GPUs** installed, as currently, LooPIN only supports this configuration.

## Onboarding Process

Follow our **onboard interactive video** for a quick and easy setup.

### Steps to Join LooPIN

1. **Register on LooPIN**: Head over to [loopin.network](https://loopin.network) and sign up using your email or Google account.
2. **Prepare Your Machine**: Ensure you have a bare metal machine with an Nvidia GPU. Navigate to the "server" section on the navbar and click on "Deploy a new machine".
3. **CLI Worker Registration**:
 - Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.
 - Run the following command to register your machine as a LooPIN worker (Find it in your guidance page):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://files.loopin.network/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --code <your-unique-code> --ip <your-ip>
```
 - This command downloads and executes the LooPIN installation script, registering your machine with the provided unique code. (Optional) You can also provide your machineâ€™s IP addressâ€”usually, the script auto-detects it.
4. **Installation and Verification**: The script will check if your machine meets the requirements and will install necessary drivers, including the Nvidia GPU driver. It will then verify your setup and register your worker. Upon successful installation, you should see the message:
```bash
LooPIN Client Connected! Waiting for the on-chain verification...
```
This indicates that the client application is installed and awaiting connection. The first-time connection may take approximately 5-10 minutes, depending on your network speed.

5. **Join the Cluster**: Once your machine connects to our cluster and shows an online tag, you are ready to contribute your idle GPU hours to the pool or engage in liquidity swapping.

## How to Uninstall LooPIN from Your Machine

If you've decided to stop using LooPIN or need to remove LooPIN for any reason, this guide will walk you through the uninstallation process.

### Uninstallation Process

To uninstall LooPIN, we'll use a simple shell script. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. (Optional) If you don't have loopin executable file, you can download it from the official LooPIN network.

```
curl -fsSL https://files.loopin.network/loopin -o loopin && chmod +x loopin
```

3. Runs the script with `--uninstall` flag:

```
sudo ./loopin --uninstall
   ```

### What the Uninstallation Does

When you run this command, it will:
1. Delete the LooPIN controller access
2. Remove the loopin-worker from your system

After running the command, you should see output similar to this:

```
Uninstalling LooPIN components...
Removed LooPIN controller access
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/loopin-worker.service.
Stopped and removed LooPIN worker service.
Removed LooPIN worker executable.
ðŸ‘‹ LooPIN has been successfully uninstalled from your system.
```

## What You'll Need

For a smooth setup, ensure you have:

- **A stable internet connection** to download necessary files and communicate with the LooPIN network.
- **An Ubuntu system with Nvidia GPUs**: This is crucial for the hardware compatibility with LooPIN's requirements.

By following these steps, you'll be fully set to start leveraging your hardware on the LooPIN network.
