# $LOOPIN Token Plan

The $LOOPIN token is the core cryptocurrency and protocol token of the LooPIN protocol, primarily serving as the incentive mechanism within the LooPIN ecosystem. The token is designed to facilitate the seamless exchange of computing resources and promote the efficient utilization of GPU power across the network.

## Launch Details

The initial launch of the $LOOPIN token occurred on the Solana devnet, marking a pivotal step in our approach to a decentralized finance (DeFi) framework focused on GPU power sharing. This preliminary issuance serves as a foundation for testing and development ahead of our mainnet deployment.

## Token Distribution

The distribution strategy for $LOOPIN tokens is designed to ensure fairness and promote widespread participation in the ecosystem:

- **10% to the Team**: To support and incentivize the core developers of the PinFi protocol.
- **20% for Ecosystem Development**: Targeting key community members, including students within the Solana ecosystem, to promote early adoption and active engagement.
- **70% to GPU Providers**: Allocating the majority of tokens to GPU providers to reward their crucial role in infrastructure support and network stability.

## Minting and Distribution Schedule

$LOOPIN tokens are minted daily to sustain the network and its participants:

- **Minting Schedule**: Every day at UTC 0:00, 100,000 new tokens are minted to the treasury account.
- **Halving Event**: The issuance rate will halve every two years, ensuring a controlled supply expansion over time.

## Token Utility

The $LOOPIN token facilitates various activities within the $LOOPIN network:

- **Staking**: GPU providers can stake tokens to participate in network validation and earn rewards.
- **Governance**: Token holders can vote on proposals that influence the development and operational aspects of the network.

## Wallet Addresses for Token Distribution

- **Treasury Address (Devnet)**: `9TP5HkgZSN3KwhsvhssRpviNFVtAAupPXcz6dJSbCnxq`
- **Team Address (Devnet)**: `6Vdj3NL7K3Mpum1oo5KZ6VLjaxi6QmHdAyFBkaf84ZQG`
- **Foundation Address (Devnet)**: `Cibq6gDmMxH7Xj6NHE7F3t8UgpwyPb7U1M258SrC7tbF`

## Note on Token Transition

The tokens currently in the devnet are part of a beta test phase. These tokens will serve as qualification for airdrops as we transition to the mainnet, providing early supporters and testers with initial stakes in the mainnet environment.
