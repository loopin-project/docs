# Amazon AWS

## What is Amazon AWS

[Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) is the worldâ€™s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally.

## How to create a new instance in Amazon AWS

The process to register and start using AWS includes a series of straightforward steps.

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'
import videoUrl from './AWS.mp4'

<div style={{ position: "relative", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%", colorScheme: "dark", borderRadius: "10px" }}>
    <ReactPlayer controls url={videoUrl} />
</div>

### Create a New Instance

1. **Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard:**
- Access the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) section. If it's not immediately visible, use the search bar at the top to find it.
2. **Launch an Instance:**
- Click on the "Launch Instance" button to start the setup process.
3. **Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):**
- For this tutorial, select the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (HVM) AMI, which is optimized for stability and performance.
4. **Choose an Instance Type:**
- We recommend the p3.2xlarge instance type, which includes an Nvidia V100 GPU, suitable for computing-intensive applications.
5. **Configure Key Pairs:**
- If you do not have an existing key pair, create a new one. Name the key pair "loopin" and download it. Ensure you save it securely as it's necessary for SSH access.
6. **Configure Firewall Settings (Important):**
- During the network settings phase, make important adjustments to allow for proper connectivity:
- Edit Network Settings
- Select Type: `All TCP`
- Set Port range: `0-65535` (Default)
- Choose Source type: `Anywhere` (Default)
- Specify Source: `0.0.0.0/0` (Default)
7. **Configure Storage:**
- Allocate at least 100GB of storage for your instance to ensure sufficient space for applications and data.
8. **Initialize and Connect to Your Instance:**
- After launching, wait for your instance to start.
- Copy the provided IP address.
- To connect via SSH, open your terminal and type:
```
ssh -i loopin.pem ubuntu@<your-ip>
```
- For users of alternate SSH managers, like 1Password, the command is slightly different:
```
ssh -o "IdentitiesOnly yes" -i loopin.pem ubuntu@<your-ip>
```

## Connect your AWS Instance to LooPIN Network

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- A stable network connection and open ports for cluster access.
- An **Ubuntu system** with **Nvidia GPUs** installed, as currently, LooPIN only supports this configuration.

### Steps to Join LooPIN

1. **Register on LooPIN**: Head over to [loopin.network](https://loopin.network) and sign up using your email or Google account.
2. **Prepare Your Machine**: Ensure you have a bare metal machine with an Nvidia GPU. Navigate to the "server" section on the navbar and click on "Deploy a new machine".
3. **CLI Worker Registration**:
 - Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.
 - Run the following command to register your machine as a LooPIN worker (Find it in your guidance page):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://files.loopin.network/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --code <your-unique-code>
```
 - This command downloads and executes the LooPIN installation script, registering your machine with the provided unique code.
4. **Installation and Verification**: The script will check if your machine meets the requirements and will install necessary drivers, including the Nvidia GPU driver. It will then verify your setup and register your worker. Upon successful installation, you should see the message:
```bash
LooPIN Client Connected! Waiting for the on-chain verification...
```
This indicates that the client application is installed and awaiting connection. The first-time connection may take approximately 5-10 minutes, depending on your network speed.

5. **Join the Cluster**: Once your machine connects to our cluster and shows an online tag, you are ready to contribute your idle GPU hours to the pool or engage in liquidity swapping.

### What You'll Need

For a smooth setup, ensure you have:

- **A stable internet connection** to download necessary files and communicate with the LooPIN network.
- **An Ubuntu system with Nvidia GPUs**: This is crucial for the hardware compatibility with LooPIN's requirements.

By following these steps, you'll be fully set to start leveraging your hardware on the LooPIN network.
